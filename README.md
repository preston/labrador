# Labrador

## About

The Labrador project is a simple Content Management System (CMS) web application for small laboratories to quickly update a web-based site for projects, publications and biographies.

## Technology

Labrador is written on the [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) framework on PostgreSQL, though others database systems (such as MySQL, SQL Server and Oracle) *should* work since no complex implementation-specific database calls are made. The web GUI is written using the AngularJS and Bootstrap frameworks.
